## Welcome to the page for the Statistical Inference Project

You can view the [Dataset](https://github.com/razcona/Statistical-Inference-Project/tree/master/Data) CSV files for the project in the Data folder.


### Google Play Store App Dataset

The Dataset that I have chosen to perform a statistical analysis for the project is one that contains details on a long list of Apps that are uploaded on the Android market's Google Play Store. There are 13 features that describe a given app.
```markdown

### The features/columns are as follows:

-App: Application name
-Category: Category the app belongs to
-Rating: Overall user rating of the app (as when scraped)
-Reviews: Number of user reviews for the app (as when scraped)
-Size: Size of the app (as when scraped)
-Installs: Number of user downloads/installs for the app (as when scraped)
-Type: Paid or Free
-Price: Price of the app (as when scraped)
-Content: RatingAge group the app is targeted at - Children / Mature 21+ / Adult
-Genres: An app can belong to multiple genres (apart from its main category). For eg, a musical family game will belong to Music, Game, Family genres.
-Last Updated: Date when the app was last updated on Play Store (as when scraped)
-Current Ver: Current version of the app available on Play Store (as when scraped)
-Android Ver: Min required Android version (as when scraped)

### Possible predictions and analysis.

With this Dataset, I hope to answer questions such as how to increase the likelyhood of having a successful app on the Google Play Store. Questions such as would uploading my app for free or for a fee(paid) factor in reaching a wider audience or user base. Also, is success predicated on how good the ratings are for the application and would a higher raiting also mean a larger amount of downloads or installs. Lastly, does the content and genre play a huge factor in the success of the Apps.
